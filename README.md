P2P Messenger is a decentralized peer-to-peer messaging application written in Python. It allows users to communicate directly with each other without relying on centralized servers, providing a secure and private messaging experience while ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

## Features

- **Decentralized:** The application uses a peer-to-peer architecture, eliminating the need for centralized servers. Users can directly communicate with each other without any intermediaries.

- **Secure Messaging:** All messages are encrypted using state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms, ensuring the privacy and security of the conversations.

- **User-friendly Interface:** The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible to users of all technical backgrounds.

- **Offline Messaging:** Users can send messages even when the recipient is offline. Once the recipient comes online, they will receive the messages.
